    "text": "When talking about data collection, storage, and/or usage, we often talk about health data and the nuances around handling data containing personal identifying information (PII) . Including conversations around Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) is a natural extension that could naturally incorporated in lectures surrounding the use of data.\n\n\nIDS is the idea that Indigenous Peoples have the right to own and control how their data are collected, managed and used [1]. IDS came from Indigenous demands for the rights to their own data, and from campaigns from these communities against the harmful use of existing Indigenous data [1]. Early Indigenous oral traditions included a complex set of rights and responsibilities concerning its use. [2]. This is often regarded as an early expression of IDS.\nMuch like their land and territories, Indigenous Peoples want control and sovereignty over the data that has (and/or will be) collected on them [2]. This is particularly relevant in the age of “open data”, where issues relating to data consent, use, ownership, and storage have increased in complexity [2]. While data can be used in a beneficial way for Indigenous communities, analyses using data on Indigenous Peoples often present with uncontrolled for biases as a result of colonization and a lack of understanding of Indigenous Peoples [2].\n\n\n\nColonization is the act of settling among and establishing control over Indigenous land and Peoples. To many, data may be seen through a colonial context as something that, too, has been taken [3].\nData on Indigenous Peoples has long been used as a weapon against them. Anderson, Walter, and Kukutai (2025( [1] write:\n\n“The violence of colonial data collection was a key strategy through which colonial authorities attempted to wrest control of Indigenous lands, lives, governing systems and collective identities. Statistical logics, classifications and taxonomies were key elements of the epistemology of colonization. Colonial officials in [Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States] were endlessly fascinated with the apparent power of quantitative data to “order” and “explain” [Indigenous Peoples]’.”\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations are one of the three recognized Indigenous Peoples in Canada.\nIn Canada, the OCAP® (ownership, control, access, possession) principles were established by the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) for First Nations to assert data sovereignty.\n\nOwnership refers to the relationship of First Nations to their cultural knowledge, data, and information.\nControl affirms that First Nations, their communities, and representative bodies are within their rights to seek control over all aspects of research and information management processes that impact them.\nAccess refers to the fact that First Nations must have access to information and data about themselves and their communities regardless of where it is held.\nPossession is the mechanism by which ownership can be asserted and protected.\n\nNote: OCAP® is an expression of First Nations’ jurisdiction over information about their communities. The principals of OCAP® are not an expression of all Indigenous communities.\n\n\n\nTo assert OCAP® (or other data sovereignty expressions for non-First Nations Peoples), one may propose a data sharing agreement . This formal contract will ensure Indigenous Peoples are prioritized while working in partnership with non-Indigenous organizations (for example, researchers, universities, private organizations, or government).\nData sharing agreements may involve a data steward  who is responsible for receiving and maintaining the data under the agreement.\nIndigenous Peoples may assert data sovereignty in different ways. In Alberta, the Alberta First Nations Information Governance Centre (AFNIGC) created a framework for data sharing agreements, which is publicly available here [4]. In this document, the AFNIGC proposed a set of considerations when creating an agreement, which include (but are not limited to):\n\nWho are the parties involved?\nWhat kind of data sharing is involved? Is it one-sided? Does it involve a linkage of data to other sources?\nWhat type of data is being collected/stored/used? Which data will be shared?\nWhat is the scope? Is this a one-time or a continued collection/storage/usage of data?\nWhat is the purpose of the data sharing?\nWhat is the data flow?\nWho is the data steward?\nWhen will the agreement be terminated?\n\nThe AFNIGC [4] highlighted the following:\n\n“It is important to develop a data sharing agreement that outlines the nature of the partnership with non-indigenous institutions as “cultural differences, unrealistic expectations, organizational constraints, and ongoing ethical and data sharing violations can create barriers that stifle or end effective partnerships” [5]. Throughout our work at the Centre, we strive to promote a community-centered approach to information governance, data repatriation efforts, and battling information poverty. This is a tool for our First Nation partners to establish their sovereign rights as individual nations and become self-determining in their information governance.”\n\n\n\n\nThere are many examples throughout history where Indigenous Data was inappropriately used without the consent of their community members from which data were taken. In the 1980s, Nuu-chah-nulth people on Vancouver Island, Canada were enrolled in a study investigating the high incidence of rheumatoid arthritis, episodic inflammatory arthritis, and lupus in their population. Over the duration of this study, more than 800 vials of blood, along with hair and other tissues, were collected from Nuu-chah-nulth people with the hope of this research benefiting them.\nThe researcher applied for federal funding from Health Canada to: “[give] clinical definition of rheumatic disease in the Nootka; identification of all affected individuals; epidemiological analysis; definition of familial aggregation of rheumatic disease; and finally, assessment of health needs of the Nootka, with respect to the treatment of rheumatic disease.” Health Canada provided $330,000 in funding for this project.\nThe study found that many of the Nuu-chah-nulth people were in fact suffering from these inflammatory diseases, but failed to substantiate the researcher’s theory that these conditions were inherited genetically. The study was essentially abandoned and no reports were provided back to the Nuu-chah-nulth people. Even if the original hypothesis was not proven, the data had shown that the Nuu-chah-nulth people had a high prevalence of arthralgis, a condition that was often misdiagnosed as a psychosomatic disorder. This information was published in subsequent work done by a related researcher, but could have benefited the Nuu-chah-nulth people more if the information was shared earlier.\n15 years after the study began, Nuu-chah-nulth people discovered that the blood they gave (with hopes of finding a cure for their ailments) was transported around the world and used for various genetic anthropological studies. These studies were outside of the scope of the research that the Nuu-chah-nulth people consented to. The researcher’s esteem grew and national news outlets and other highly regarded researchers began citing his anthropological findings.\nThe Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation were left behind. Larry Baird, who offered his blood and the blood of his children, was quoted in a local newspaper [6] to say:\n\n“We were of the understanding that we would have the results of the study within a year, but he nevertold us anything. He disappeared. He used us like cheap guinea pigs.”\n\nIn 2004, many of the blood vials were sent back to the Nuu-chah-nulth people, and were later destroyed. This incident is regarded as one of the key studies forming regional and national guidelines for research involving Indigenous Peoples in Canada.",

    "text": "Variables related to race and ethnicity are present in most studies involving human data. However the the lack of standardized guidelines in including such variables in analyses can lead to biased inferences for many underrepresented populations [1]. Oftentimes, race and ethnicity categories are coarsened to have a more reasonable number of possible levels., thus omitting complex racial and ethnic identities which are grouped into broader categories. These may not account for the unique lived experiences of smaller or mixed-race identities) [1]. Such simplifications may lead marginalized groups to be underrepresented in studies, furthering the feeling of invisibility and a lack of belonging [1].\nWe explicitly define race as a group of people who are arbitrarily categorized according to common physical characteristics, regardless of language, culture or nationality, as per Statistics Canada. We define ethnicity as the shared cultural, linguistic or religious characteristics of a group of people having a common history, heritage or ancestry. While these terms are often used interchangeably, there is a distinct difference which we emphasize here.\nThe ways in which we present classifications of variables related to both race and ethnicity can have profound impacts on marginalized communities. “White” is frequently shown at the top of tables, and typically used as a reference group to which other groups are compared [1]. Doing so can reinforce ideas of white supremacy, stemming from Colonialism.\nClassifications and taxonomies were key elements of colonization over Indigenous Peoples. Colonial officials in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States used the power of quantitative data to “order” and “explain” Indigenous Peoples [2]. In the United States, American Indian/Alaska Native identity is often not considered as a category when variables on race are collected, resulting in the erasure of American Indian/Alaska Native Peoples in studies [1].\nIn Canada, Métis have typically been recognised as a “mixed-descent identity”, which undermines the Métis Nation as a self-governing Indigenous nation with associated rights [2].\nThere have been ongoing discussions on how to appropriately include considerations of race and ethnicity into studies, including a guide for researchers in British Columbia.\nA guide summarizing how Indigenous Peoples were represented in the Canadian Census from 1870 to 2021, see [3].",

The principals of OCAP® are not an expression of all Indigenous communities."
