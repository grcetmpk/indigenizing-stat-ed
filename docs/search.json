This is a hub for educators in the fields of Statistics and Data Science to learn about how they can incorporate Indigenous topics into their classrooms in a way that is organic and appropriate.\nWe will be providing tools that will allow educators to confidently and appropriately do the following:\n\nIncorporate Indigenous knowledge into their current curricula\nFacilitate discussions on the impact of data on Indigenous communities\nAppropriately use Indigenous data in classroom examples\n\nModules are create for various statistical topics, so that they can be used across a variety of courses and levels.\nThis work is done in consultation with the Xwi7xqa Library at the University of British Columbia."

    "text": "When talking about data collection, storage, and/or uses, we often talk about health data and being careful with personal identifying information (PII). Including conversations around Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) is a natural extension that could easily be included in lectures for this topic.\n\n\nIDS is the idea that Indigenous Peoples have the right to own and control how their data are collected, managed and used (Andersen et al. 2025). IDS came from Indigenous demands for the rights to their own data, and from campaigns from these communities against the harmful use of existing Indigenous data (Andersen et al. 2025).\nEarly Indigenous oral traditions included a complex set of rights and responsibilities concerning its use. (Kukutai and Taylor 2016). This is often regarded as an early expression of IDS.\nMuch like their land and territories, Indigenous Peoples want control and sovereignty over the data that has (and/or will be) collected on them (Kukutai and Taylor 2016). This is particularly relevant in the age of “open data”, where issues relating to data consent, use, ownership, and storage have increased in complexity (Kukutai and Taylor 2016). While data can be used in a beneficial way for Indigenous communities, analyses using data on Indigenous Peoples often present with uncontrolled for biases as a result of colonization and a lack of understanding of Indigenous Peoples (Kukutai and Taylor 2016).\n\n\n\nColonization is the act of settling among and establishing control over Indigenous land and Peoples. To many, data may be seen through a colonial context as something that, too, has been taken (Rodriguez-Lonebear 2016).\nData on Indigenous Peoples has long been used as a weapon against them. Andersen et al. (2025) writes:\n\n“The violence of colonial data collection was a key strategy through which colonial authorities attempted to wrest control of Indigenous lands, lives, governing systems and collective identities. Statistical logics, classifications and taxonomies were key elements of the epistemology of colonization. Colonial officials in [Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States] were endlessly fascinated with the apparent power of quantitative data to “order” and “explain” [Indigenous Peoples]’”"
