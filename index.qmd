Welcome to the launchpad of ***Indigenizing Statistics and Data Science Education*** (ISDSE). This is a hub for educators in the fields of Statistics and Data Science to learn about how they can incorporate Indigenous topics into their classrooms in a way that is **organic** and **appropriate.**

We will be providing tools that will allow educators to confidently and appropriately do the following:

1.  Incorporate Indigenous knowledge into their current curricula

2.  Facilitate discussions on the impact of data on Indigenous communities

3.  Appropriately use Indigenous data in classroom examples

Modules are create for various statistical topics, so that they can be used across a variety of courses and levels.

This work is done in consultation with the [Xwi7xqa Library](https://xwi7xwa.library.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia.
